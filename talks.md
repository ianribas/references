[Sneak Peek of Graph Capabilities with the Elastic Stack](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/comparing-angular-ember-react) | javascript, web frameworks, angular, ember, react | No clear decision or recommendation, even if the author uses Angular! Nice overview of a choosing process. A good amount of rehash of other peoples ideas.
[Beyond Lists](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/data-structure-lists) | data structures | Interesting and pretty low level overview of data structures. Even some database concepts used for in memory data structures.
