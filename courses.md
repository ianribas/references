Excellent hands on course.

#### Introduction to Recommender Systems

- https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems

Excellent course on recommender systems, even if not really technical. I specially appreciated some of the more *meta* topics on ethics, explanations and how to use, or not, such systems.

#### Introduction to Functional Programming

#### Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems: Part 1

- https://www.coursera.org/course/androidpart1
- University of Maryland, College Park
- Coursera

This one and the following course are entry level courses on the android platform. A little too basic for experienced programmers, but interesting nonetheless. The use of unit tests on the programming exercises was very nice.

#### Introduction to MongoDB using the MEAN Stack

- https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MongoDBx+M101x+3T2015/info

Interesting overview of the technology, even if a bit overly simplified. I imagine it would be hard to really understand what is going on if you don't have some background.

A little basic and really not hands on enough. Some things didn't work right off and no notes to help ...

#### Introduction to Big Data Analytics

- https://www.coursera.org/learn/bigdata-analytics
- University of California, San Diego
- Coursera

This and the following two courses are very superficial and a little overly simplified. Was useful mostly as a way of forcing me to do some entry level tutorials and to get some of the jargon.
